## About the Project
This is an experimental script for AFK fishing in Russian Fishing 4  

Currently, it supports both bottom and spin fishing, along with other useful scripts like making  

groundbaits and foods or moving arounnd the map without pressing w key.

## Built With
* Python 3.11 
  
## Getting Started
### Install
```
git clone https://github.com/dereklee0310/RF4_fishing_bot
```
### Prerequisites
* **Enable Mouse ClickLock in Windows**
* **Change game language to English**
* **The reel must be fully loaded**

To install dependencies and initialize user configurations:  
```
.\setup.bat
```

## Usage
Before executing the script, you must move to the desired fishing location and set up the rods.

For bottom fishing, you need to put all the three rods down first. Otherwise, you only need to  

pick up the rod you want to use for spin fishing.  
### Change the current directory
```
cd src
```
### Execute the script
```
python app.py
```

## Troubleshooting
* **Change resolution to 2560x1440 or 1600x900**
